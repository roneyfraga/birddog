Description: Provides a unified set of methods to detect scientific emergence 
  and technological trajectories in academic papers and patents. The package 
  combines citation network analysis with community detection and attribute 
  extraction, also applying natural language processing (NLP) and structural 
  topic modeling (STM) to uncover the contents of research communities. It 
  implements metrics and visualizations of community trajectories, including 
  novelty indicators, citation cycle time, and main path analysis, allowing 
  researchers to map and interpret the dynamics of emerging knowledge fields.
