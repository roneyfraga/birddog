\title{Identify Key Routes in Citation Networks}
\usage{
sniff_key_route(network, scope = "network", citations_percentage = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{A network object of class \code{tbl_graph} or \code{igraph} containing
citation data, or a list object generated by \code{sniff_groups()} when
\code{scope = "groups"}}

\item{scope}{Character string specifying the analysis scope. Must be either
"network" (for full network analysis) or "groups" (for group-wise analysis
of a grouped network)}

\item{citations_percentage}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the
percentage of top-cited edges to consider for key route identification.
Default is 1 (all edges)}
}
\value{
A list containing for each group:
\itemize{
\item \code{plot} - A ggplot2 object visualizing the key citation route
\item \code{data} - A tibble with publication details (name, TI, AU, PY)
of nodes in the key route
}
}
\description{
This function identifies and visualizes key citation routes within scientific
networks by analyzing the most significant citation paths between publications.
The algorithm is based on the main path analysis approach described in:
Liu JS, Lu LYY. An integrated approach for main path analysis: Development
of the Hirsch index as an example. Journal of the American Society for
Information Science and Technology. 2012;63(3):528-542.
https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.21692
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps based on the main path analysis methodology:
\enumerate{
\item Converts the citation network to a line graph where edges become nodes
\item Filters edges based on citation percentage threshold
\item Identifies the largest connected component
\item Calculates all simple paths between source and sink nodes
\item Determines the main citation route using forward and backward propagation
\item Extracts and visualizes the key citation path
}

The algorithm implements an integrated approach for main path analysis as described
in Liu & Lu (2012), which combines structural analysis with citation metrics to
identify the most significant knowledge diffusion paths in scientific literature.
